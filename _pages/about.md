tl;dr: I like computers and [here's my CV](https://resume.creddle.io/embed/1q5l39bldu6)

Welcome to my website! I'm a software developer from Montreal living in San Francisco and
working at [Yelp](http://yelp.com). By day, I work on the [Yelp Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yelp.android)
and the Python backend that powers it on the Search User Experience team.
By night, I like to tinker with all the trendy new frontend web technologies,
read books and watch documentaries on Netflix. I'm a hackathon enthusiast
and helped to start the hackathon culture at [Concordia University](http://www.concordia.ca/encs.html)
by organizing the university's first ever hackathon [ConUHacks](https://2016.conuhacks.io/).

I started out as a frontend web developer and have only recently moved into doing
Android app development. How did that happen you ask? I'm still not sure myself
but I always love diversity in my work. The more variety I'm exposed to on a daily
basis the happier I am as a developer! That being said, I regularly write JavaScript,
HTML, CSS, Python, Java and SQL.
