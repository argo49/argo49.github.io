tl;dr [Here's my CV](https://resume.creddle.io/embed/1q5l39bldu6)

Welcome to my website! I'm a software developer living in San Francisco and
working at [Yelp](http://yelp.com). By day, I work on the [Yelp Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yelp.android)
and the Python backend that powers it, and by night I like to tinker with all
the trendy new backend and frontend web technologies.j
