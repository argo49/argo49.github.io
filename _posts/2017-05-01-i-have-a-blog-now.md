Wow, an actual blog. It's been three years since I updated this site. Three years is a long time in
internet years! Why update now? Well, I've been meaning to update for a couple
of months now after a co-worker shared a link to my website in an email and I
felt the familiar shame and embarrassment of looking at code I wrote before
I knew any better. But what really sealed the
deal for me that it was time to update was the [May1Reboot](https://www.may1reboot.com/#/) project.

The idea is simple:
set a deadline for everyone who wants to participate to update their website
or portfolio. I think it's exactly the kind of motivation I needed (that and my
hosting credits on my old hosting provider are going to run out [on the same day](https://twitter.com/argo_49/status/846388186188177409)).

I don't know what I'll be writing about or how often I'll be posting, but I feel
like it's important for a professional software developer to have a blog for three
reasons:
1. Knowledge sharing
  - Make the things you've learned available to others
  - Helping people!
2. Demonstrating your ability to communicate
  - Make the things you've learned available to others in a way that doesn't make
    the reader confused or fall asleep!
  - This is also important to show potential employers that you're competent and
    can clearly explain a complex topic
3. Knowledge crystalization
  - Ok I just made that word up, but people say that one of the best ways to learn
    and retain information is to break it down and teach it to someone else

I'll probably write about new things I learn about playing around with React,
Redux, GraphQL and all those things. I'm also relatively new to the Android ecosystem
so writing about Android-related topics from a web developer's point of view
would also be useful to me and hopefully to someone else!
I might also toss in a few off-topic posts every once in a while
on something that isn't related to software. I'll try to keep the bar on
quality relatively low so I don't get bogged down by the pressure of writing
extremely high quality content, but at the same time I want the technical pieces
I write to be correct and the non-technical pieces to be entertaining.

Here's to yet another new blog on the internet!
