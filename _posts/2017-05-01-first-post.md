Wow, an actual blog. It's been three years since I updated this site. Three years is a long time in
internet years! Why update now? Well, I've been meaning to update for a couple
of months now after a co-worker shared a link to my website in an email and I
felt the familiar shame and embarrassment of looking at code you wrote before
you knew any better. What really sealed the deal for me that it was time to
update was the [May1Reboot](https://www.may1reboot.com/#/) project.

I had never heard of it before but apparently it's a thing that was happening in
the early 00's that stopped for a while and now it's coming back. The idea is simple:
set a deadline for everyone who wants to participate to update their website
or portfolio. I think it's exactly the kind of motivation I needed (that and my
old hosting provider).

I don't know what I'll be writing about or how often I'll be posting,

## Hey wow how'd you do that thing on the [homepage](/)?

I'm glad you noticed that when you click on all the stripes everything lights up!
And dat text, it's all aligned with the stripes!
